## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a model that inputs ECG (Electrocardiogram) data and outputs a detailed report. The report will focus on diagnosing various heart pathologies. The training of the model is based on the [Will Two Do? Challenge 2021](https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2021/1.0.3/) dataset from PhysioNet.



## Dataset
The [Will Two Do? Challenge 2021](https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2021/1.0.3/) dataset, available from PhysioNet, is the cornerstone of our training process.
